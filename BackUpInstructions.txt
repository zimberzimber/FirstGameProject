Seems like Visual Studio handles directories in some bullshity unholy way, just dragging and dropping files doesn't work.
Thank you Microsoft, you made me spend 1:30 hours of my life raging like a monkey at a desk trying to figure out what the fuck is up with my project.
I will never forgive you.

1) Rename the current work folder to the backup name
2) Create new project in Visual Studio in the same directory, give it the name of the working directory
3) In the new project, remove the project under the solution
4) Copy the project relevant files (defined classes, the .csproj, MainPage.xaml, MainPage.xaml.cs, and assets folder) into the newly created project
5) Add the project to the solution by right clicking the solution, adding an existing project, and selecting the .csproj file in the same directory
6) Wonder why the fuck is moving to a different directory is retardedly stupid
7) ???
8) No profit. Only pain.
